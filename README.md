# Alternative TCM Search Engine

## What is this?

This is a web application that provides an alternative search engine for movies on TCM (Turner Classic Movies).

## How do I use it?

Just [click here](http://tcm.ptak.io/) and give it a try!

## Why did you make this?

I find TCM's search function kind of cumbersome. You can't filter on more than one genre or by release year, and clicking on a movie takes you to a new webpage. I would rather just see a filterable, sortable list of what is available, which is what this page does.

## Why isn't there an option to filter by such-and-such?

Go ahead and open an issue! I plan on adding lots more options to this program in case anyone finds them useful.
