# Gimme TCM Movies

## What is this?

This is a simple frontend webpage for checking what movies are available to
watch on TCM. It uses TCM's API, but adds filters so you can pare down the
list.

## Why did you make this?

I find TCM's web interface a little bit cumbersome to use. You can't filter on
every available genre or by release year, and clicking on a movie takes you to
a new webpage. I would rather just see a filterable, sortable list of what is
available, which is what this page does.

## Why isn't there an option to filter by such-and-such?

Go ahead and open an issue! I plan on adding lots more options to this program
in case anyone finds them useful.

## What is the `gimme-tcm-movies.py` file?

I originally wrote this program as a Python script, but pretty soon I re-wrote
essentially the same functionality in an frontend-only Elm app. I think it is
nicer to use that way, but you can still use the original script if you desire.

Just run `python gimme-tcm-movies.py --help` for basic usage information.
